//A Barrage shapelet accepts forces and transformations as though it were not managed by an evil secret machine
//and this allows us to pretty much Do The Right Thing. I've chosen to actually hide the specific kind of shape as an
//enum prop rather than a class parameter. The pack pragma makes me reluctant to use non-POD approaches.
//primitives MUST be passed by reference or pointer. doing otherwise means that you may have an out of date view
//of tombstone state, which is not particularly safe.

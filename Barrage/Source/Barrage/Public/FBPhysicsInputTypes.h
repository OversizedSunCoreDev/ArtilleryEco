	// Throttle only applies to characters at the moment, but may come to be used for vehicles.
	// Throttle offers four variables. Generally, these scale:
	//x: carry over velocity from the prior tick
	//y: gravity
	//z: locomotion (self-directed thrust generated as part of the core movement model)
	//w: forces (thrust applied by abilities, including jump or dash)

//this is a busy-style thread, which runs preset bodies of work in a specified order. Generally, the goal is that it never
//actually sleeps. In fact, it only ever waits on the Artillery busy thread.
// 
// This is similar to but functionally very different from a work-stealing or task model like what we see in rust.
// This thread runs ticklites, which are simple functions that satisfy the following properties:
// They are order insensitive. Surprisingly, most things are.
// They do not run the tick they are applied.
// They operate only on gameplay tags, abilities, and transforms.
// Anything that would normally be a ObjectPtr, SharedPtr, or Reference of any kind should be replaced by a key unless you are absolutely sure that object has a match-duration lifecycle.
// This is because expired ticklikes may be reactivated during rollback, as one would expect. Because we reverse attribute and tag _state_, those will be _ticked_ as normal.s 
// They modify only gameplay tags and abilities as of this writing. Transforms may become possible with Jolt.
// In the interim, we will support velocity change events submitted to the busyworker. This may be the permanent system.
// In general, if it cannot be accessed through Artillery, Thistle, or Sunflower, do not use it.
// The gameplay tags and abilities they operate on are owned and managed by the artillery system.
// They run on this thread, rather than the gameplay thread.
// They have either a duration, a lifecycle owner, or are created by a gameplay experience that serves as their lifecycle owner.*
//  
// * This is not enforced.
// 
// Unlike OnTick, which can't make even rudimentary guarantees about when or how often it will run,
// Ticklikes run on the artillery tick rather than on the UE frame. They also run on this thread,
// rather than the gamethread. FInally, and most importantly Ticklikes can be attached to anything,
// not just actors. this allows one ticklike to move multiple projectiles, affect multiple actors,
// or do things like batch process conditions such as frozen. This sounds like a performance optimization,
// and in many ways it is, but it also creates a far easier usage semantic than gameplay effects which often struggle
// despite being nominally more flexible.
// 
// It also means they must be written in C++ for the time being. Hopefully, we can relax this restriction.
// Fortunately, because they are NOT assets, it is trivial to make them data driven. This means we need quite few
// of them overall, and that they can be easily instanced and referenced from blueprint. 
// 
// Finally, Ticklikes may be used to trigger the firing of ArtilleryGuns on the next frame and
// any complex ticklike should probably work this way during prototyping. It does mean the earliest
// possible firing is 2 frames after application, but at 120ticks per second, that's 16ms.
//  
// As a result of being unable to fire the frame they are added, and unable to fire guns on the frame they fire,
// the fastest cadence we allow a ticklite to be checked at is 2. Cadences are aligned for entire groups.
// Do not rely on cadence to ensure ordering.
// 
// If ordering is mandatory, absolutely mandatory, start by using Phase. If that's not a strong enough guarantee,
// consider using either an ArtilleryAutoGun or triggering an ArtilleryGun from your ticklite. In general, though,
// effects like thorns should apply in the last phase. Phases are intended to order ticklikes relative to other ticklikes.
// Any additional ordering benefits they provide should be considered UB for the time being, and should not be relied on.
// 
//  Good luck, and may the force be with you.

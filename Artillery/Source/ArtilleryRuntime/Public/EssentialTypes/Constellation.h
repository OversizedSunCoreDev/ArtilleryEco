//Unlike almost all other designs, the constellation is a concept that has no formal equivalent in most ECS systems
//It's a fully privileged entity-of-entities that may or may not have a type on top of that. Think of it as an Entity Facade
//with the actual entities being Whatever is stored in the Relationship Attribute Map. Or think of it as a db record with just foreign keys.
//We really don't want these to proliferate wildly, but they're very nice for understanding things like player state without
//breaking UE's expectations.

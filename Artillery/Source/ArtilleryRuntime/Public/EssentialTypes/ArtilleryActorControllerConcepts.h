//This is the set of CONCEPTS in the C++ sense. Traits, arguably. In artillery, anything can have an artillery tick, not just actors.
//This is already basically true in UE, but the various tickables aren't unified in the way you address and interact with them.
//There's really good reasons for this, because the problem UE solves is WAY more general. That's why we use interfaces-as-concepts
//so that it's easy to tie the two models of thinking together into something pretty harmonious.
//
//Makes it easy to just add an artillery tick onto something when doing integration, and know that you can mount it into the correct
//control flows.

//You can think of an artillery tick as a LITTLE like a Unity Fixed Update, except that because it's threaded,
//it's totally decoupled from the frame\UETick. They don't block each other, and artillery really only offers truly
//strong determinism guarantees for game simulation modifications on the artillery tick. This is..... a source of some problems.


//TICKHEAVY VS TICKLITE
//Artillery ticked controllites are separate from ticklites, much more expensive, and run concurrently with them.
//They are a kind of TICKHEAVY. Get it? Hahaha.. ha...

//pronounced Controllite. I hope that helped. :)
//This is the minimum required for artillery to express control over something.
//That might be an actor, it might be a component, it might not have a UObject at all.
//Could be a static mesh, even. It's somewhat unfortunate that this concept is coming to fruition so late in
//the development of the system, but I think as we tidy, it'll prove very useful.

//This is not simple stuff, and I apologize, but it's less screwy than what we had.

//So, making a TickHeavy, huh? They're pretty expressive, but they carry some additional requirements about determinism

//we use this interface for the statetrees as well. Those are a little less cut and dry, though. You could use the base
//interface, instead of this one, unless you're in a similar control flow to the existing use of controllites.

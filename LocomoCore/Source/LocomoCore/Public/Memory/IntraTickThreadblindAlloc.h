//This allocator relies on both an arena AND a pool. Each arena is bound to the TICK that created it. Each arena
//is retained as long as that tick remains relevant. this is SPECIFICALLY useful for things that have a dynamic memory
//load unsuitable for a strict linear allocator but that can be deallocated in a single operation at a known safe time.
//The name is not a joke. This is safe, but it's not simple.

// This allocator is used in the following way. Allocate an arena block within a tick. Allocate using this
//allocator wrapper as normal. Within the duration of the tick, this acts as a normal pooled allocator built
//on the TLSF. You are responsible for the TrueLifecycleManager which is a shared pointer. This makes an ideal
//allocator for self-contained large objects that have highly variable internal structure.
//This is a BAD choice for a general purpose allocator. It is also probably a bad choice for objects with
//extremely regular internal structures.

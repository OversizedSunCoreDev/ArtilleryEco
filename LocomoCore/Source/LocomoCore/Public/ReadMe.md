Hi! So glad you're here! This is a collection of weird useful stuff that represents
"secret knowledge" in the games industry. I'm writing this at the beginning of 2025, 
at a moment where the industry is in terrible flux and the sweeping layoffs have destroyed
an entire culture of knowledge. Locomo doesn't preserve all of that. Nothing could. 
But it does capture a lot of interesting techniques and tools. I've focused on weird math used for cameras,
controls, fast checks, that sort of stuff. Some of it's little stuff that's 20% faster. Some of it's a completely different
approach to the problem.


Sorry the guide here isn't better, but I'm trying to also make a videogame.  
Isn't that always how it goes?

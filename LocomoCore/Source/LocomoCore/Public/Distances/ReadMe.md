Probably some of the most useful stuff in here! You might not expect it, but it's often
useful to compare how far apart things are in something other than 3d space or with something other than
euclidean distance. Used to be, we used squared distance all the time in games cause it was fast...  

But it turns out it actually has a bunch of useful properties, too! There's a lot of other distances like this
where a simple transform can make very hard problems far far easier. This is a collection that I've found helpful!
In particular, they can be quite good for controls and gamefeel, where euclidean distances might not do a good job of
actually representing how a stick moves in its socket on a controller, for example.

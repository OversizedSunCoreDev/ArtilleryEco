# LocomoCore
LocomoCore collects fragments from a number of movement modes from empirically observed designs, samizdat, or whiteboard doodles and distills them into novel, non-derivative pure math. LocomoCore DOES NOT provide complete movement systems, locomotion state machines, or anything comparable. The goal is not to steal or otherwise copy product identity. Instead, small mathematical tricks or bits of cleverness that would normally be lost are preserved here.  

Originally, LocomoCore was GPLv3, however I cannot in good conscience write more code for game development that is GPLv3.  

Unfortunately, it is the most powerful corporations that benefit most from GPLv3 now, as they are able to use it illegally with impunity or place it behind network and process barriers that exempt the code from virality. For a long time, I rejected this as cruel cynicism, but sadly, recent litigations have made it a matter of public record. But on top of the existing proven indignities, the rise of generative AI systems trained on GPLv3 code is an indisputable fact. My opinion on the rightness or wrongness of that is utterly irrelevant. This is not an argument founded on emotion. Instead, I want to underscore the simple fact of the matter: it has made the license pointless, or worse than pointless.  

If you can generate equivalent code that is not covered by training on code that is covered, then we must assume the license means nothing.
